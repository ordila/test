## Features

- **Follow/Following Interaction:** Clicking on the "Follow" button changes the text to "Following" and adjusts the button color. The number of followers is also updated accordingly.

- **Persistent State:** The user's interactions persist even after refreshing the page. If a user was followed, the "Following" state is maintained.

- **Unfollow:** Clicking the "Following" button reverts it to the initial "Follow" state, and the number of followers decreases.

## Backend - Mockapi.io

A custom backend was created using [Mockapi.io](https://www.mockapi.io/) to simulate user data. The `users` resource includes fields like `id`, `user`, `tweets`, `followers`, and `avatar`. There are 13 users in total with varying values for testing.
